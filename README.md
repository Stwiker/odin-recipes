# odin-recipes

This project is building a basic recipe website that links to a few different recipes. By completing this project, I will have learned how to add, commit, and push to Git while also demonstrating my HTML skillset.

Credits to Lilly at The Lazy Dish for the White Chicken Enchiladas recipe and photo.
